#OOPS: Object oriented programming
# OOPS is object oriented programming is a paradigm that uses "objects" to design application and computer programs.
# OOPS contains of class and ojects
#class: class is a group of objects that contains common properties
# Object: object is a instance of class
#objects are allocated memory space when they are allocated.
# OOPS Concepts:
#1.Class
#2.object
#Inheritance
#Polymorphism

#class is a collection of variables and methods
# A class is a blue print...logical entity
# doesnot occupy space in the memory


#An object is a instance of the class
# object is aphysical entity
# it occupy certain amount of space in memory

# For 1 class we can create n nuber of objects

#Function VS Method:
#without creating a class if we create function then it is ageneral function
# if we create afunction with creating a class then it is called method.
